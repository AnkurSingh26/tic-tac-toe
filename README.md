INSTRUCTION
This Java program implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in which a participant competes towards the laptop. Let's ruin down how the code works:

Game Board Representation: The sport board is represented using' and '-' characters for formatting.

Player and CPU Positions: Two ArrayLists (playerPositions and cpuPositions) are used to preserve music of the positions chosen with the aid of the player and the computer, respectively.

Main Method: The predominant approach initializes the game board, prints it, and then begins an infinite loop for the sport to preserve until there is a winner or a draw.

Player's Turn: Inside the loop, the participant is induced to enter their circulate (function on the board). The program assessments if the selected role is legitimate (not taken) after which updates the game board hence the use of the placePiece technique.

Checking for Winner: After the player's flow, the program exams if there is a winner or if the sport led to a draw by using calling the checkWinner approach.

CPU's Turn: If the sport is still ongoing, it's the CPU's flip. The CPU generates a random position that isn't always already taken and updates the sport board.

Printing the Game Board: After the CPU's circulate, the up to date recreation board is printed once more.

Checking for Winner (Again): The software checks for a winner or a draw after the CPU's circulate.

Winning Conditions: The checkWinner technique exams for triumphing situations via comparing the positions of the participant and the CPU towards predefined lists representing winning combos. If any of those combos are located, the technique returns a corresponding message indicating the winner. If all positions are filled without a winner, it returns "CAT" indicating a draw.

End of Game: If a winner is located or the sport ends in a draw, the loop breaks, and the game ends.

Overall, this system offers a easy textual content-based interface for playing Tic-Tac-Toe in opposition to the laptop.
